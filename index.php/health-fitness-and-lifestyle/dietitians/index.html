<p><strong>Dr. Bianca Drennan, BSc, ND Naturopathic Doctor BSc in Nutritional Sciences</strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; float: left;" src="../../../images/stories/bianca.png" alt="bianca" />Bianca has been an advocate of long-term health and wellness for much of her life. Growing up in an Italian family gave her an appreciation for how food and lifestyle are connected. From planting a garden with her grandfather to cooking traditional Italian dishes with her grandmother, Bianca learned early on that diet had a significant impact on health.</p>
<p>Bianca followed her passion for diet and health to McGill University, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Nutritional Sciences. Specializing in sports nutrition, Bianca moved her passion into a career by studying the relationship between what we eat and how our bodies perform through the lens of science. Hooked by the potential to help people with day-to-day health and wellness by working on the root cause, and not the symptoms, of health issues, Bianca completed the four-year post-graduate Bachelor of Naturopathy program at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM).</p>
<p>CCNM is one of two board-certified naturopathic medical schools in Canada. During her time at CCNM, she interned at the Robert Schad Naturopathic Clinic - the largest naturopathic clinic in Canada. During her internship, she interned at Sherbourne Health Center, treating patients with HIV/AIDS. She also interned at Queen West Community Health Centre, which focused on treating patients with mental health conditions. Bianca has treated a wide-range of health concerns, but has special interests in diabetes, weight loss, stress management, and digestive conditions. Bianca practices evidence-based nutritional and naturopathic medicine combined with clinical experience to successfully guide her patients towards optimal health.</p>
<p>Bianca can work with you in achieving your goals, which will lead you toward optimal health. She is excited to work with the Jump6 Weight Loss Program to help clients achieve longterm wellness.</p>
<p><strong>Memberships:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bianca is a licensed Naturopathic Doctor and is regulated under the Regulated Health Professions Act (RHPA). She is a member of the Ontario Association of Naturopathic Doctors (OAND) and the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors (CAND).</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Zhou, RD&nbsp;</strong><strong>Registered Dietitian</strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; float: left;" src="../../../images/stories/Joanne-Zhou.png" alt="Joanne Zhou" /></p>
<p>I am a Registered Dietitian with a degree from McGill University in Nutritional Sciences. My clinical nutrition training has taken place in a community health centre, ICU and Oncology Outpatient settings in a hospital, COPD rehab centre and a long-term care facility. I have a special interest area in wellness innovations and open to alternative strategies you may bring.</p>
<p>Born in Shanghai, raised in Tokyo and Sydney, I now live in Toronto. It was through working at a school garden that rooted me in my passion for food. Picking crisp kale and eating fresh cherry tomatoes made me appreciate healthy food and inspired my eventual study of nutrition.</p>
<p>What fulfills me the most is when I help others realize their dreams. Even just one small goal met can create positive changes that trickle into other areas of life. What we eat directly impacts our future health and is empowering to know we can do something about it.</p>
<p>Those with experience in the often frustrating world of weight loss are well aware of healthy eating. What we need most is someone to give us the tools to build habits. In this way, I see my role as more of a lifestyle coach rather than simply an educator. I will be supporting you for your whole Jump6 program. In our sessions together we will come up with small goals that grow into larger ones. Making progress no matter how small helps in growing long-term healthy habits that stick.</p>
<p>Other than nutrition, my interests include experimenting with new recipes, eating locally, contemporary art, photography and tennis. I have an active social media presence on topics related to nutrition and innovation. You can follow me on twitter @jwnzhou.</p>
<p>Specialties: weight loss, diabetes prevention, COPD, ICU, oncology, Parkinson&rsquo;s, geriatrics and anemia.</p>
