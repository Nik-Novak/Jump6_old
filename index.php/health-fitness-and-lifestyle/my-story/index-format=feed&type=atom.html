		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://jump6.com/images/Amanda.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amanda&quot; /&gt;I wanted to share my personal experience with weight loss and the intra-gastric balloon in hopes it will help others in their decision in their personal weight loss journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What appealed to me most about the balloon is that it is a non surgical approach, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want anything permanent and certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t want surgery, I just wanted to feel good again in my clothes and more confident. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling great about myself and really hated getting dressed to go out What appealed to me most about the balloon is that it is a non surgical approach, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want anything permanent and certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t want surgery, I just wanted to feel good again in my clothes and more confident. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling great about myself and really hated getting dressed to go out for dinners and functions. I knew if I could lose 20 lbs I would feel so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day of my balloon procedure I weighed 166 lbs, now at 5&amp;rdquo;4&amp;rdquo; that was a bit too heavy for my frame. I could not believe I weighed that much&amp;hellip;.I was embarrassed! I guess my college years of late night eating and pub nights really caught up with me and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed how much weight I had gained. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is no magic fix for weight loss, no pill , no surgery that will do all the work for you, but I will say the balloon gave me the motivation and initiative to start exercising, to lose a little weight a bit faster than I would have on my own. In the first week I lost 10 lbs and several inches, I already felt better just 10 lbs down. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how much one can weigh and literally how much weight that has on our psychological well being. I already felt lighter, getting dressed already wasn&amp;rsquo;t as much as a nightmare as it was the week before. I was learning more about portion control, and really understanding nutrition. I started taking an interest in cooking and learning about reading labels. Now if you would have asked me a year before the balloon if I read labels I would have told you no way! Who has time for all that. In all honesty though it really has made a difference in how I grocery shop , what I cook, and ultimately what I feed my body. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am happy I did the balloon because I am not sure I would have had the motivation to attempt this on my own. Losing 35 lbs I gained so much more...as clich&amp;eacute; as that sounds! Truly it motivated me to feed my body well, and I started exercising, I took up running and it is my escape. I love putting on my headphones and tying up my laces and feeling that rush of ...yeah I can do this! I don&amp;rsquo;t believe you don&amp;rsquo;t need an expensive gym membership to get in shape there are so many ways to stay active without having to go to a gym. The living room can be your gym, your office can be your gym, or even the outdoors can be your gym. Its about achieving something a little each day, a little more than the day before and setting realistic goals for yourself. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be an all star at the gym to go to one, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to have the best gym clothes to go to one...you just have to feel motivated and empowered for yourself. I feel so much better about myself, I dropped 4 pant sizes and I will say shopping became a good experience again...almost too good! I love going to stores I was always afraid to go in...I like knowing that if I see something I am not afraid to try it on. Losing some weight not only benefited my overall health but my psychological health. I feel so much better and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not always about the scale but its how you feel about yourself. I tell everyone, it has to make you happy inside. If your comfortable at a size 12 and you feel good then that&amp;rsquo;s great, if you have a desire to want to look better, feel better and take control of your health then I would say the balloon is a great way to start. It is not permanent, non surgical approach and there is 1 year support with a health coach and team of Naturopath Doctors and Registered dietitians. It gave me the start to lose weight, educate myself about food and balance. I realized I can still enjoy the foods I crave but in moderation and in a healthy way. If your out there and frustrated with your weight, just start with making small changes, walking around the block, swapping the potatoes for a salad more frequently, and maybe cooking one night when you would normally eat out. All these little steps towards a healthier you can make a big impact, and like I said before, sometimes it makes more of an impact on your emotional psychological health that can give you so much and the people you love in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda&lt;/p&gt;
